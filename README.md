# terminal-discord-beta READ NOW
An add-on so that you can use discord and code at the same time. 

Examples are in the repository. 

## Steps to Use Terminal Discord (Beta Edition) 

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers and create a bot. If you do not know how to do this, go to https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html. 
2. Add this bot to the servers you want to talk in. 
3. Create a new folder on your computer, and set up an npm project with `npm init`. 
4. Install `discord.js@12` to this folder with `npm i discord.js@12`. 
5. Copy Paste main.js in this repository and edit the file as needed. THERE ARE FILL IN THE BLANKS YOU HAVE TO FILL ON THE MAIN.JS TEMPLATE FILE. 
6. Run with `node main.js`, or any other way you set it up with. 

Note that these are suggested directions. If you are an experienced programmer, you can edit the code and customize it to your own needs, or even set up nodemon for a faster experience. I would appreciate it if you would support this development by starring this repository or contributing.
